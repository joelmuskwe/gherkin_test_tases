## General - Git

1. The structure of the repository when committed was missing a few things. Best practices include adding a `.gitignore`.
  - If you're on a Mac, Finder will automatically produce a `.DS_Store` file. This file by nature has no use to anyone but the person committing, so we should add it in the `.gitignore` file. Check out the file I added.
  - In this ignore file you can also add `.idea` for example if youre using Intellij IDE.
2. Folders. Put your files in folders. Note how I created folders to structure the files in this repo.

## Feature

1. See `git diff`
